# Proof of Memory (POM)

## Project Overview

Proof of Memory (POM) is a decentralized application designed to commemorate attendance at events by issuing verifiable digital collectibles. Similar to Proof of Attendance Protocol (POAP), POM aims to provide a blockchain-based record that participants can collect to remember the events they've attended. The unique proposition of POM lies in its decentralized verification process, utilizing Kleros for adjudication to ensure authenticity and integrity.

## Key Features

- Event Tokenization: Users can mint a POM token as a proof of their attendance at an event.
- Decentralized Adjudication: Kleros protocol is used to arbitrate the legitimacy of events and the issuance of POM tokens, ensuring a trustless and transparent system.
- NFT Integration: Each POM is an NFT, providing uniqueness and ownership to the holder, representing their personal collection of memories.
- Community Engagement: Holders can interact with each other, share their collections, and participate in community voting for event verification.

## User Workflow

- Event Submission: Users submit evidence of their attendance at an event to mint a POM.
- Kleros Arbitration: The submission is reviewed by Kleros jurors who validate the claim based on the evidence provided.
- Token Minting: Upon successful verification, the POM token, as an NFT, is minted and assigned to the user's wallet.
- Proof of Memory: The user now owns a digital collectible that serves as a decentralized and immutable proof of attendance.
